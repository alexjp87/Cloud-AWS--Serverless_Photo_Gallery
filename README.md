# Cloud/AWS - Serverless Photo Gallery


## Cloud/AWS project - practice using cloud technologies & AWS services by building a photo gallery web app with a scalable, serverless architecture


### Project Goals
The goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience using AWS services in a cloud environment.


### Project Description
'Serverless Photo Gallery' is a cloud-based photo gallery application that allows users to upload, view, and delete images.

AWS services are leveraged to provide a scalable, serverless architecture with minimal infrastructure management.

Users interact with a web interface hosted on Amazon S3, where they can upload photos, view their gallery, and manage images.

The backend logic is handled by AWS Lambda, which processes image uploads and deletions, while metadata is stored in Amazon DynamoDB.

The application is designed to dynamically fetch and display images from Amazon S3, offering a fast and cost-efficient solution for hosting a photo gallery without requiring the management of servers.
